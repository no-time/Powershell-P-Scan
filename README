README

This is just a quick port scanner for powershell. I wrote this because I was not allowed to use nMap in an enterprise environment.
To note this is MUCH slower than nMap or other scanners, because it is running through powershell, but it does an okay job of 
checking to see if a port is open or closed. 

Feel free to modify, module, parameterize or edit to make this a bit more portable.
